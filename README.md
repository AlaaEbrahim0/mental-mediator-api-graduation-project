# Project: Nexus (Graduation Project)

## Description:
Nexus is a comprehensive project developed as part of my final year in computer science college. It serves as a testament to my proficiency in backend development using ASP.NET Core. Currently in the development phase, Nexus prioritizes the implementation of a robust RESTful API adhering to Onion Architecture principles, clean code practices, and sound design principles.

## Features:
- Utilized Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for optimized SQL queries and LINQ operations'
- Implemented pagination for efficient data retrieval.
- Integrated Google SMTP server for mailing services to enhance communication capabilities.
- Integrated Cloudinary api for image storage services
- Developed a Unified Api Response using the Result Pattern
- Collaborated with Flutter and React teams to facilitate understanding of data structures and API responses.
- Created comprehensive class diagrams and sequence diagrams for clear communication.
- Implemented JWT Bearer authentication scheme for enhanced security and scalability with role-based access mechanisms
- Containerized the application with Docker for seamless deployment.
- Leveraged AutoMapper for efficient mapping between DTOs and entities.
- Used Bogus library for database seeding to facilitate testing.
- Developed a detailed Postman collection for API testing and documentation.
- Added real time notification system using SignalR

## Technologies Used:
- ASP.NET Core 8
- SQL Server
- EF Core
- Docker
- Postman

This project showcases my ability to architect, develop, and optimize robust backend solutions, demonstrating proficiency in a range of modern technologies and best practices in software engineering.
