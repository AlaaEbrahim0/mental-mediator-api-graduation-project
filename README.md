# Project: Nexus (Graduation Project)

## Description:
Nexus is a comprehensive project developed as part of my final year in computer science college. It serves as a testament to my proficiency in backend development using ASP.NET Core. Currently in the development phase, Nexus prioritizes the implementation of a robust RESTful API adhering to Onion Architecture principles, clean code practices, and sound design principles.

## Key Contributions:
- Implemented Generic Repository, Result, and Options Patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- Utilized Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for optimized SQL queries and LINQ operations.
- Collaborated with Flutter and React teams to facilitate understanding of data structures and API responses.
- Developed a detailed Postman collection for streamlined API testing and documentation.
- Conducted load testing to support 100 concurrent users with an impressive average response time of approximately 200 ms.
- Created comprehensive class diagrams and sequence diagrams for clear communication.
- Implemented JWT Bearer authentication scheme for enhanced security and scalability.
- Containerized the application with Docker for seamless deployment.
- Leveraged AutoMapper for efficient mapping between DTOs and entities.
- Used Bogus library for database seeding to facilitate testing.
- Implemented pagination for efficient data retrieval.
- Integrated Google SMTP server for mailing services to enhance communication capabilities.
